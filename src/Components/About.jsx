          Hello there! Iâ€™m a Front-end Developer from Raipur, Chhattisgarh,
          India. Since my youngest age I have been passionate about design and
          art. I grew up with the Internet, and naturally took a path according
          to this passion. Web Development is a way for me to keep track of all
          my passions. See ya!

          With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for
          creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without
          compromising on browser support and performance.
